## Ethics Questions

### Question 1

> Give two possible chatroom moderation features and the reasons that you should implement each one

<!-- Put your answer to question 1 here -->
There should be an ability to kick users and also mute users in the chatroom. This is mostly if someone starts posting offending messages you can give them a warning with a mute for a certain amount of time but then harsher you can kick them from the chatroom for bad behavior.
